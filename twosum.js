/*
Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so: (index1, index2).

For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.

The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).

Can you create a JavaScript function that satisfies the following? Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so: (index1, index2).

Certainly! Here's a JavaScript function that finds two numbers in an array that add up to a target value and returns their indices in an array:

javascript
Copy code
function twoSum(numbers, target) {
  const numMap = new Map();

  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - numbers[i];

    if (numMap.has(complement)) {
      const complementIndex = numMap.get(complement);
      return [complementIndex, i];
    }

    numMap.set(numbers[i], i);
  }
}
This function uses a hash map (implemented using a Map in JavaScript) to store previously encountered numbers and their indices. It iterates through the array, calculating the complement (the difference between the target value and the current number). If the complement is found in the hash map, it means we have found a pair of numbers that add up to the target value, and the function returns their indices.

You can test this function with the example you provided:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(twoSum([1, 2, 3], 4));  // Output: [0, 2] or [2, 0]
The function should output either [0, 2] or [2, 0], as both represent valid solutions to the problem.

Can you rewrite the above function with comments so that I can understand it a little better?

Certainly! Here's the rewritten JavaScript function with comments explaining each step:

javascript
Copy code
function twoSum(numbers, target) {
  // Create a hash map to store numbers and their indices
  const numMap = new Map();

  // Iterate through the array of numbers
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    // Calculate the complement (the difference between the target and the current number)
    const complement = target - numbers[i];

    // Check if the complement exists in the hash map
    if (numMap.has(complement)) {
      // If the complement exists, retrieve its index from the hash map
      const complementIndex = numMap.get(complement);
      // Return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target
      return [complementIndex, i];
    }

    // If the complement doesn't exist, add the current number and its index to the hash map
    numMap.set(numbers[i], i);
  }
}

//Other Solutions
function twoSum(numbers, target) {
  for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length-1; i++) {
      for (var j = i+1; j < numbers.length; j++) {
          if (numbers[i] + numbers[j] === target) return [i, j];
      }
  }
}

//Other Solutions
function twoSum(numbers, target) {
  let seen = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    let x = numbers[i], y = target - x;
    if (seen.has(y))
      return [seen.get(y), i];
    seen.set(x, i);
  }
}

//Other Solutions
function twoSum(numbers, target) {
  for (i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    second = numbers.indexOf(target - numbers[i], i+1);
    if (second > i) {
      return [i, second];
    }
  }
}
