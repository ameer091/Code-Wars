Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.

As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(

So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1, 1, 1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:

[1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]
But what if we started with [0, 0, 1] as a signature? As starting with [0, 1] instead of [1, 1] basically shifts the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:

[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]
Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.

Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if n == 0, then return an empty array (except in C return NULL) and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)

If you enjoyed this kata more advanced and generalized version of it can be found in the Xbonacci kata

[Personal thanks to Professor Jim Fowler on Coursera for his awesome classes that I really recommend to any math enthusiast and for showing me this mathematical curiosity too with his usual contagious passion :)]

function tribonacci(signature, n) {
  // Check if n is 0, return an empty array
  if (n === 0) {
    return [];
  }
  // If n is less than or equal to 3, return the slice of the signature array based on n
  else if (n <= 3) {
    return signature.slice(0, n);
  }

  // Create a new array to store the Tribonacci sequence, initialize it with the signature
  const tribonacciSequence = [...signature];

  // Generate the Tribonacci sequence up to the desired number of elements (n)
  for (let i = 3; i < n; i++) {
    // Calculate the next number by summing the last three numbers in the sequence
    const nextNumber = tribonacciSequence[i - 1] + tribonacciSequence[i - 2] + tribonacciSequence[i - 3];
    // Add the next number to the sequence
    tribonacciSequence.push(nextNumber);
  }

  // Return the generated Tribonacci sequence
  return tribonacciSequence;
}


//Other Solutions
function tribonacci(signature,n){
  for (var i = 0; i < n-3; i++) { // iterate n times
    signature.push(signature[i] + signature[i+1] + signature[i+2]); // add last 3 array items and push to trib
  }
  return signature.slice(0, n); //return trib - length of n
}

//Other Solutions
function tribonacci(signature,n) {
  const result = signature.slice(0, n);
  while (result.length < n) {
    result[result.length] = result.slice(-3).reduce((p,c) => p + c, 0);
  }
  return result;
}

//Other Solutions
function tribonacci(s,n){
  var arr = [];
  for(var i=0; i<n; i++) {
    arr.push((i<3) ? s[i] : arr[i-1]+arr[i-2]+arr[i-3]);
  }
  return arr;
}
